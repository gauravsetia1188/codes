  Collections interface is extended by List interface;so apart from supporting all the methods of  Collections interface,
  it has some of its own methods also as mentioned below.
  
  Implemented below using ArrayList class.
  
  1.
  l1.add(2,s); // s is object name
  will insert s at position 2 and shift all the elements present on its right side by one position to the right.
  
  2.
  l1.set(2,s); // s is object name
  will replace element present at index 2 with s (no shifting will be there).
  
  3.
  l1.get(2,s); // s is object name
  returns element present at index 2.
  
  4.
  l1.indexOf(s);
  returs index of s
  
  5.
  l1.lastIndexOf(s);
  returs index of last occurence of s.
  
  **Points 4 and 5 return -1 if the specified object is not present.
